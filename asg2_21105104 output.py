                                             ##ASSIGNMENT - 2

## 1. For a given input string “Python is a case sensitive language”. Write python
##    code for the following:
# a. Find the length of the input string.

The length of string is 35

# b. Reverse the order of the string in one line code.

# c. Using Slice function store “a case sensitive” in new string.

New sliced string:-  a case sensitive language

# d. Replace “a case sensitive” with “object oriented”.

New string:-  Python is object oriented language
  
# e. Find index of substring “a” in the given input string

Index of required substring is-  10

##   f. Remove the white spaces from the given input string.
New string:-  Pythonisacasesensitivelanguage


## 2. Store your name, SID, department name and CGPA into different variables.
##    With the help of String formatting print the following output:
##    Hey, ABC Here!
##    My SID is 2110XXXX
##    I am from XYZ department and my CGPA is 9.9

Enter your name here:- Vidit Sarin
Enter your SID here:- 21105104
Enter your Department Name here:- Electronics and Communication
Enter your CGPA here:- 10
Hey, Vidit Sarin Here!
My SID is 21105104
I am from Electronics and Communication department and my CGPA is 10.000000


## 3. For a=56 and b=10 with the help of bitwise operators calculate the following:

# a. a&b

a&b=  8

# b. a/b

a/b=  5.6

# c. a^b

a^b=  50

# d. Left shift both a and b with 2 bits.

After left shift by 2-bits a=  224
After left shift by 2-bits b=  40

# e. Right shift a with 2 bits and b with 4 bits.

After right shift by 2-bits a=  14
After right shift by 2-bits b=  0

## 4. Write a python program to find the greatest of three numbers entered by the user.

Enter the first number-  30
Enter the second number-  40
Enter the thied number-  50
The greatest number is- 50

## 5. Write a python program to check if the word “name” is present in the string entered by the user (Print : “Yes” or “No”).

Enter the sentence/string - My name is Vidit Sarin
Yes

## 6. For any three lengths, there is a simple test to see if it is possible to form a
##    triangle. If any of the three lengths is greater than the sum of the other two,
##    then you cannot form a triangle. Otherwise, Enter three sides of a triangle,
##    converts them to integers, and to check whether the given input lengths can
##    form a triangle or not (Print : “Yes” or “No”).

Enter the first side-  3
Enter the second side-  4
Enter the thied side-  5
Yes..the given input lengths can form a triangle
